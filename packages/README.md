# List of useful programs for Ubuntu based systems
Program | Explanation
--------|---------
Todo.txt | Terminal based to-do application, nifty to track larger projects, especially with Gnome extension: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/570/todotxt/
Discord | Keeping you in the loop. Also good for gaming, if you are into that.
Norminette | Essential for your school work.
Docker | Great for various web projects. Also pretty integral, if your filesystem goes haywire, so you won't have to configure all nginx settings and mysql tables again.
Vim/Emacs/Nano | Learn to use one text-editor to rule them all. Serverside and containers rarely have anything else to use.
Node.js | Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. If that didn't say anything, well, don't worry. If you want to create a web server serving static sites or perhaps an API, you can do it.
NPM | Node.js package manager. If you got this, you can install packages to your javascript project.
lldb | Command-line LLDB Debugger (LLDB) is the debugger component of the LLVM project.
valgrind | Hunt your pesky memory errors and more on your CLI.
gnome-tweaks | Making your desktop to look fancy.
powerline | Makes your pointer in CLI look great. Also tells you in which branch you are.
